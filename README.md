# mlre

mlre is an extended version of brian crabtreeâ€™s mlr for norns.

new features and functionality were added with performative aspects in mind, attempting to extend the capabilities and expressiveness of the script.
like mlr, mlre runs on softcut, a multi-voice playback and recording system for manipulating audio buffers in real time, which was written by ezra buchla.

thank you both, as well as many others from the norns community for all your efforts, countless contributions and sharing of knowledge.
