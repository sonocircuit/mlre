# mlre


## work in progress



This an adaption of tehn's mlr script.

At first this started as a personal project to lean to code in lua (or to code in general). As I started to understand a bit more about the architecure and basics of norns scripts and softcut, many ideas came to mind, which I wanted to implement in mlr (because it is my favourite and most used script). These additional features are built around the original script, so the core of mlr remains unchanged.

I'd like to point out that there might be some bits of code that probably are redundant or features that could be coded more efficiently/elegantly. PR's are welcome.

Also, this wouldn't have been possible without the countless contributions made by many members of ////////! Studying other scripts and comments on forum and discord channel have been, and will continue to be, a immense source of knowlage!

A special thanks to **tehn** for creating mlr and **zebra** for softcut and answering questions, **justmat** for hnds and many bits of code and **infiniate digits** for bits of code, answering questions and giving me ideas.


**TODO:**
- [ ] cleanup code
- [ ] implement loop resize on record end
