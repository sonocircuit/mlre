# mlre

This an adaption of tehn's mlr script.

mlre started as a personal project to learn to code. Understanding more about the architecure and basics of lua, norns scripts and softcut sparked many ideas. These additional features are built around the original script, so the core of mlr remains unchanged.

I'd like to point out that there might be some bits of code that might be messy/redundant or features that could be coded more efficiently/elegantly. PR's are welcome.

Also, this wouldn't have been possible without the countless contributions made by many members of ////////! Studying other scripts and comments on the forum and discord channel have been, and will continue to be, **an immense source of knowlage**! 

A special thanks to **tehn** for creating mlr and **zebra** for softcut, answering questions and some helpful lines of code, **justmat** for hnds and bits of code from "otis" and **infinitedigits** for answering questions and some bits of code from "oooooo".
